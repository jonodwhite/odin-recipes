          <h3>Description</h3>

                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
                <li>4 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>8 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
                <li>8 ounces shredded Emmentaler Cheese</li>

          <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add white wine, cherry brandy, garlic clove, cayenne, nutmeg, and cornstarch to a saucepan. Whisk to combine and place on the stove over medium heat. Cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture thickens slightly and you can see wisps of steam in the pan, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add Gruyere and Emmentaler cheeses, one handful at a time, slowly whisking after each addition until melted. Continue whisking until all cheese is melted and sauce is very smooth. Remove from the heat and transfer into a fondue pot to serve.</li>
                <li>Keep sauce warm while serving so it doesnt solidify.</li>
            </ol>
